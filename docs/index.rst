   If you hit an error while building documentation with a new theme, it is
   likely due to some theme-specific configuration in the ``conf.py`` file
   of that documentation. These are usually ``html_sidebars``,
   ``html_theme_path`` or ``html_theme_config``. Unsetting those will
   likely allow the build to proceed.
